And even more, TypeScript became the recommended language to be used to build Angular 2.0 application. It is time to learn it, isn’t it?  TypeScript is an open source programming language designed for development of large single-page applications. It is a strict superset of JavaScript with optional static typing and class-based object oriented programming support.  On the following session I am going to introduce the audience to TypeScript programming language. We will talk about classes, interfaces, modules, generics, decorators and many other features available in the language. At the end the audience will have a solid TypeScript foundation and, more importantly, when they should use it and how to start using the language in existing JavaScript projects.",

TypeScript is an open source programming language designed for development of large single-page applications. It is a strict superset of JavaScript with optional static typing and class-based object oriented programming support.  On the following session I am going to introduce the audience to TypeScript programming language. We will talk about classes, interfaces, modules, generics, decorators and many other features available in the language.
